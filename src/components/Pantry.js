          <p>
            From the pantry to cupboards to the refrigerator, the following is a
            list of staples you would find me using regularly in my own kitchen.
            All pantry and refrigerator items are part of a plant-based diet,
            and are products that I have used and can be found within the vegan
            recipes.
            <br />
            <br />I hope you find this useful and inspring, and just FYI I only
            recommend products I have tried and truly trust!

            <strong>LEGUMES</strong>
            <br />
            Legumes are an easy source of protein in a vegan diet and are
            extremely versatile. Legumes are low in fat, high in protein and
            fiber, and carry essential micronutrients and phytochemicals to keep
            you at your best. Cooked fresh is best, but canned is great too for
            those who need a more convenient option. From Hummus, Veggie
            Burgers, tacos, burritos, Creamy Broccoli & Red Lentil Soup or Split
            Pea Soup, Black Bean, Broccoli & Avocado Salad, Lentil & Hummus
            Wraps, to pasta dishes, all types of legumes can be used in various
            ways creating an endless supply of high protein, plant-based meals.
            Just make sure you've got some beano on the side!

            <strong>GRAINS</strong>
            <br />
            Grains make for great fillers and main meals. Full of fiber and
            protein, fuel up with breakfast foods like this Cinnamon Oatmeal,
            DIY Muesli, and Overnight Buckwheat & Steel-Cut Oat Breakfast Jars.
            For the later meals, add rice of choice, farro, wheat berries,
            quinoa, etc. to complete your main meals. Many of these grains are
            gluten-free and should be used as part of a healthy diet.

            <strong>PASTAS</strong>
            <br />A good pasta dish is so comforting. My favorite pasta is the
            good old fashioned spaghetti and meatballs, or spaghetti and spicy
            meat sauce. I love making this Vegetable Lo Mein, Pasta Salad, and
            good old-fashioned Noodle Soup. Each pasta has its place and keeps
            my pantry varied. And, for those worrying about getting enough
            protein, there’s even a high-protein pasta on the market these days!

            <strong>FLOURS</strong>
            <br />
            If you love baking and making vegan pancakes, flour is going to be
            essential. Even if not, you’ll want to have some on hand for recipes
            that call for small amounts (like when thickening gravies or
            sauces). Spelt flour is my favorite, which bakes up beautifully,
            making for perfect vegan pancakes, muffins, cookies, and bread.
            Following spelt would be almond flour, buckwheat flour, and chickpea
            flour. I usually have about 4 flours on hand at any given time, all
            of which I store in the refrigerator to maintain maximum freshness.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>almond flour</li>
            <li>buckwheat flour</li>
            <li>cornmeal, grits, polenta</li>
          </ul>
          <Container className="centeredImage">

            <strong>NUTS & SEEDS</strong>
            <br />
            All around, nuts and seeds are great as toppers and snacks. You’ll
            be amazed what you can make with them…i.e. tahini, cashew ricotta
            cheese or almond parmesan, nutmeats, nut butters, raw energy bites,
            no-bake cheesecake, etc. Having a nice assortment on hand will be a
            plus! I store mine in mason jars and keep them in the refrigerator
            for maximum freshness.

            <strong>SWEETENERS</strong>
            <br />
            Natural sweeteners, my favorite and most used is pure agave syrup.
            Dates are a favorite as well to sweeten shakes, smoothies, and
            no-bake desserts. Coconut sugar has a wonderful caramel flavor, like
            brown sugar, that I love to bake with. If watching sugars, monk
            fruit sweetener is a great alternative.

            <strong>SPICES</strong>
            <br />
            Spices are what will make your meals come alive. I love the
            simplicity of allowing my vegetables to shine, but sometimes I like
            to use many spices at once to really make a dish flavorful as
            possible. I have a large selection in my pantry, but find that I
            usually stick with a few key ones that I love. Use spices to take
            old recipes and change them up using a different blend. In some
            recipes, I prefer to use fresh herbs like basil, cilantro, and
            parsley, while the rest I’m happy to use dried. I recommend
            purchasing the freshest dried herbs and spices you can find for the
            best flavor!
          </p>

            <strong>OILS</strong>
            <br />I try to use oils as sparingly as possible, but do keep a few
            on hand. And depending on what my dish is going to be will depend on
            my oil. When baking, I use light flavored olive oil and coconut oil,
            and sometimes I’ll switch it up with grapeseed oil. Sesame oil is
            used mainly for stir-fries and Asian-style cooking. When roasting or
            sauteeing vegetables, I use either olive, grapeseed, or coconut oil.
            Extra virgin olive oil is used for dressing and non-heat recipes.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>coconut oil</li>

            <strong>VINEGARS</strong>
            <br />
            Vinegar adds a nice zest and tang to dishes, my favorite and most
            used is apple cider vinegar, which so happens to be the healthiest
            of them all. Vinegar is great in an assortment of recipes from
            stir-fries (for which I use rice wine vinegar), to salad dressings
            (all vinegar work here), and soups are great with a splash of
            balsamic. Vinegar also lends a hand when acid is needed, like making
            vegan buttermilk and cheeses.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>apple cider vinegar (unfiltered)</li>

            <strong>CANNED & BOTTLED GOODS</strong>
            <br />
            So, I love to cook from scratch, however I realize that not everyone
            has the desire or time to do that as well. Here is where canned
            goods can be a great saver of time and energy, and keeping your
            pantry stocked with some of these essentials means you’ll be able to
            pull something together with ease. When purchasing these items, try
            to buy glass bottled products whenever possible and look for
            BPA-free cans.
